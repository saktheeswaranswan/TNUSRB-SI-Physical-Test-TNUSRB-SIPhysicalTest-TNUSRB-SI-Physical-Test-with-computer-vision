To run the provided C++ code for YOLOv3-tiny object detection, follow these steps:

Set up the environment:

Make sure you have C++ development tools installed on your system.
Install OpenCV library and configure it properly.
Save the code: Copy the code provided in the previous response and save it to a file, e.g., yolov3_tiny_detection.cpp.

Download the necessary files:

Download the YOLOv3-tiny weights file (yolov3-tiny.weights), configuration file (yolov3-tiny.cfg), and the COCO class names file (coco.names) and place them in the same directory as the C++ code file (yolov3_tiny_detection.cpp).
Build the code:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the code file and the downloaded files.
Compile the code using the following command:
css
Copy code
g++ yolov3_tiny_detection.cpp -o yolov3_tiny_detection `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`
Make sure to adjust the pkg-config command if you have a different version of OpenCV installed or if you are using a different package manager.
Run the code:

After a successful compilation, run the code using the following command:
bash
Copy code
./yolov3_tiny_detection
Observe the output:

The code will open a window showing the live camera feed with bounding boxes and class labels for detected objects.
Detected objects will be saved as separate images in the same directory as the code.
The detection details with timestamps will be appended to the detections.csv file.
Note: Ensure that your system has a camera connected and accessible to capture video frames. Adjust the code if you want to use a different video source (e.g., a video file) by modifying the cv::VideoCapture initialization.

g++ yolov3_tiny_detection.cpp -o yolov3_tiny_detection `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`


./yolov3_tiny_detection
